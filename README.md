- Click the green Code button at the top of the repo.

- Copy the link that shows.

- Open the terminal where ever you would like to store the files and type the following.

```
git clone (then paste)
```

- Once that has completed you must install the dependencies by typing.

```
npm install
```

- This should install everything you need for to run it yourself which you can do by going back to the console and typing this script.

```
npm start
```
